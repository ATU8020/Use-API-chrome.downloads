# Target
The purpose of this project is to use the API chrome.downloads

# node-modules
I use the module `"@types/chrome": "^0.0.171"` to further assist with coding for `chrome extension`. See the package.json file for more information if you'd like.

# Guide
Focus on files like `manifest.json` `background.js` `contentScript.js` `popup.js` because those are important files that will help you understand most quickly what I am trying to tell you.
